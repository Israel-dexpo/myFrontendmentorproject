                                I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                                 I've been looking to make a transition and I've heard some people who had an amazing experience. 
                                 I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly after. 
                                 The next twelve weeks were the best -and most grueling- time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup

                               Before Joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.I needed a structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                                I was encouraged to enrol by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The curriculum and staff didn't disappoint. They were very hands-on and I didn't have to wait long for assistance. 
                                The apple team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
